        description: `I’ve known Valenti for a few years; we circled each other as something like mutual admirers before we ever talked to one another in person. He’s best known as the founder of Ghostly International, the venerable record label he started from a University of Michigan dorm room in 1999. Ghostly is mostly known as an electronic music label, but when you take a closer look at the label roster it’s like thumbing through the record collection of a free-form radio DJ.
        Ghostly emerged during a relative fallow period for American electronic music. Valenti is from the Detroit suburbs, and has a deep appreciation for the different sounds the Motor City has incubated over the decades. He entered the city’s club scene as a teenager, carrying records for Detroit legend DJ House Shoes and playing gigs with Mike Servito. His love for Detroit carried over to Ghostly’s first release, the funky house track “Hands Up for Detroit” by Matthew Dear whom Valenti met in his first week of undergrad. Dear’s song was both an indication and a smokescreen of where Ghostly was headed. The label would become an electronic music tastemaker, of course, but also became known for signing hard-to-define acts like Tycho and Ginger Root. Being genre-agnostic doesn’t go against the Ghostly philosophy, Valenti told me. “The human has to be leading through all the music," he said.
        Last month, Valenti published a coffee table book that looks back at Ghostly’s first 25 years. I wanted to talk to him about what he’s seen change in that quarter century, as Valenti has always had an expansive, optimistic view of the music community’s ability to adapt and endure, which runs counter to so much of the current discourse. One thing that was clear after our conversation is that Valenti knows that even after 25 years of shaping part of the music landscape, he knows the next generation is coming for him. And he’s just fine with that.`,
